          Risk Disclosure – Products & Services
        </h3>
        <p>
          Over the counter (OTC) leveraged derivative products, including
          Contracts for Difference (CFDs) and currencies in the spot market are
          complex financial instruments that carry a high level of risk. The use
          of leverage can magnify both gains and losses; in some cases, losses
          may exceed the initial investment. These products may not be suitable
          for all investors.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-2">
          Before engaging in any trading activity, you should carefully assess
          your investment objectives, level of experience, risk tolerance, and
          overall financial situation. We strongly recommend seeking independent
          financial or professional advice before trading.
        </p>

          Disclaimer
        </h3>
        <p>
          CFDs and other leveraged OTC financial instruments involve a
          significant risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. You should
          ensure that you fully understand how these instruments work and
          consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your
          capital.

          Trading is carried out at your own discretion and risk. Stonefort
